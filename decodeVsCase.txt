Both DECODE & CASE statements will function like IF-THEN-ELSE statement and they are the alternatives for each other. These functions are used in Oracle to transform the data values.

For Example:

DECODE Function 

Select ORDERNUM,
DECODE (STATUS,'O', ‘ORDERED’,'P', ‘PACKED,’S’,’SHIPPED’,’A’,’ARRIVED’)
FROM ORDERS;
CASE Function

Select ORDERNUM
, CASE (WHEN STATUS ='O' then ‘ORDERED’
WHEN STATUS ='P' then PACKED
WHEN STATUS ='S' then ’SHIPPED’
ELSE ’ARRIVED’) END
FROM ORDERS;
