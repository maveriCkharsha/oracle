Use index by tables when:
	Your program needs small lookups
	The collection can be made at runtime in the memory when the package/ procedure is initialized
	The data volume is unknown beforehand
	The subscript values are flexible (e.g. strings, negative numbers, non-sequential)
	You do not need to store the collection in the database

Use nested tables when:
	The data needs to be stored in the database
	The number of elements in the collection is not known in advance
	The elements of the collection may need to be retrieved out of sequence
	Updates and deletions affect only some elements, at arbitrary locations
	Your program does not expect to rely on the subscript remaining stable, as their order may change when nested tables are stored in the database.

Use varrays when:
	The data needs to be stored in the database
	The number of elements of the varray is known in advance
	The data from the varray is accessed in sequence
	Updates and deletions happen on the varray as a whole and not on arbitrarily located elements in the varray
